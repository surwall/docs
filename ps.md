## workspace
Yes, you are correct. In Adobe Premiere Pro, a "workspace" is a predefined layout of panels and windows within the application. Each workspace is designed to serve a specific purpose and streamline different aspects of the video editing process. Workspaces act as predefined layouts that arrange various panels and tools for particular tasks or workflows.

To access the different workspaces, go to the "Window" menu at the top of the Premiere Pro interface and select the workspace you want to use. Alternatively, you can use the dropdown menu in the top right corner of the Premiere Pro interface to switch between workspaces quickly.
