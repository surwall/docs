# Calculus

## Find the limit of a function 

### Squeeze theorem

The squeeze theorem tells us that if we have three functions, f, g, and h such that...

1. $g(x) <= f(x) <= h(x)$ for all x-values other than x =c  in a interval around x = c, and 
2. $\lim\limits_{x \to c}g(x)=\lim\limits_{x \to c}h(x) = L$

Then we can conclude that $\lim\limits_{x \to c}f(x) = L$



The calculus can divide into two parts: Differentional Calculus and Integral Calculus.

### Differentionation

This relates to the concepts of derivatives. Derivatives measure how a function changes at a specific point, representing its instantaneous rate of change. Making the increase of $x$ really small, we are getting the a time approaches 0, that gives us the thing which is the limit of that specific point.

$$
f'(x) = \lim\limits_{\Delta x \to 0}\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}
$$

The delta x just means the increased time amount, in this case, is really small and very close to 0. which means this can represent the "speed" of that time. In other world, just the change rate.
