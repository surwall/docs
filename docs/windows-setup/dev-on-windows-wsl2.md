Wsl2 is useful but not perfect. For example, the custom kernel modified by Microsoft used in Wsl2 have so many limitations that you can't run lxc container inside Wsl2, though you can use some hacks to [replace with your custom kernel](https://gist.github.com/jacky9813/927261020bb1dacc1a7baedef657b732), however, I found that it's kind of missing the point of using wsl2.
