## use custom dns

Dhcp might overwrite the /etc/resolve.conf

So you might use some tools to prepend your custom dns servers.

You can make static additions to /etc/resolv.conf. Those additions could override the things that are being automatically added.

First, install the resolvconf package.

Then, press Alt+F2 and run gksudo nautilus. Open /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/head if you want to add to the start of the file; open /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/tail if you want to add to the end. Make your changes, save/close the files, and then run sudo resolvconf -u to apply the changes.

(Sorry that I don't remember if the settings at the start or end of the file have the highest priority.)
