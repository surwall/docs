# Mirror

In China, because of the GREAT WALL, any Internet connection to abroad servers will be extremely slow. In order to overcome this, we could use proxy server. However, proxy server's bandwidth costs, so we have set up a mirror repository for various things to reduce bandwidth and improve connectivity, like ubuntu apt source, npm mirror site, etc.

The following are just a list of all mirrors in China:

1. [大学镜像集合](https://mirrors.cernet.edu.cn/list)
