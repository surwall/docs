# Language Overview
After delved into programming worlds five years or so, I really have a feeling that whenever I want to learn a new language, I don't get the essense of it. I always try to learn the syntax and nerdy part of it, after several months, I don't use this language in my projects, I start to forget the basic syntax of it. In turn, I have to really relearn again when I need it. An idea hit my brain that what is the core of the languages? Or in other words, how to use pareto method to learn a new language?

From my perspective, in modern software development, we tend to use libraries to meet our needs, we don't re-invent wheels. In turn, reading documentation fill a large part of our development. This really raises another question: how can we organize our code so that our code is robust and not coupling with those libraries. If some libraries are outdated, we can replace them without a hitch.

So, we are not learning any syntax, because syntax are similar, but we are going to learn the typical file structure and organization of a project. 

For languages like Java, and NodeJS. Those are file-based. Each file is a module, if you wanna use it elsewhere, you have to explicitly import it.
